# All Roads Lead To Maycaster

## Preface
It's been two years since the appearance of a powerful necromancer in the lands
of Morrius. The kingdoms failed to take action until the first few cities
fell to the growing army of the undead. The combined armies of the world
succeeded only in slowing the undead march across the continent. With the fall
of Ivyport, the walled city of Maycaster welcomes its last wave of refugees.

There is no where left to run, nowhere left to hide from Shemov's army of
darkness.

# The Howling Owl
The party gathers in a bustling tavern just inside the walls of Maycaster. A bard strums at his lyre, struggling
to be heard over the rowdy crowd raising a ruckus by the bar. The bar is a 
melting pot of displaced soldiers and criminals. Brin, the veteran, tells them
he's gathered the party to look for the location of a portal to another realm
where the necromancer doesn't exist.

## NPCs:

### Quest giver

Brin Mooncutter(Veteran)
A soldier who escaped from the battle of Ivyport, Brin has been collecting a
body of research to find ancient weapons to fight the undead. He learned of a
portal, but has to return to the front lines to attempt to retake Ivyport
tomorrow and wants the adventurers to go to the castle to figure out where the
location of the portal can be found.

If the players ask, he will give written permission to the party so that they
can easily access the private library in the castle.


### Owners

Karma Girnidre - Mother of Geraldine and wife of Healdi, she is responsible for
selling popular heart-shaped pastries in the tavern.

Healdi Girnidre - Husband of Karma and fater of Geraldine, he is responsible for
guarding the tavern and pouring drinks.


### Misc

like seeing all these miscreants in the tavern.

### The Ivory Bats

Leader(Bold Charles)(Bandit Captain) - After turning his bandit crew to mercenaries,

returning to this tavern every day since then and trying to pay for his drinks

## Encounters

### Introduction
The party piles into the howling owl, finding that Brin is waiting for them at
a table. He waves them over.

"Take a seat, people. You all know that things are grim.
The necromancer just pushed us out of Ivyport and took a lot of good men.
There's nowhere left for us to retreat if these walls are breached, and that's
why tomorrow I'm leading an attack to take back Ivyport."

### Interjection

Bold Charles calls in.

"What makes think you stand a chance against the dark army? Saw with
muh own eyes as Ivyport's men were cut in two by the undead horde. Don't think
we've got as many left as were lost in that fight."

Brin looks to the adventurers. 

"The bandit's right. We're only buying time with this
attack. That's where you come in. I've heard rumors of a portal nearby that 
leads somewhere out of the necromancer's reach. If you can get through the
portal, you might be able to send for help, or find somewhere for us to flee."

### Bandit shenanigans

Bold charles chimes in again.

"You really thing this scrawny lot's going to save you? I give ten gold that
y'cant arm wrastle the likes of me." DC 1d12+2

Bold charles rolls his eyes and pays up if they win.

"Well.. tell you what, I saw Cheating Norvin deal from the bottom of the deck."
He stands the other bandit up against the wall and places an apple on his head.

"Knock this off his head, and I'll tell you what I know."
DC 1d12+2

If adventurers win, they find out that there's a lady on trial in the castle
that knows the location of a cult that probably has something to do with any
portals in the area.

### Exit encounter

Brin tells the party that he has to go ready his men for the morning.
He hands them a hand-written note permitting their entrance into 
Castle Maycaster. 

"I bet there's some information about this portal in the library in Maycaster.
Go look there and you might find some clues."

As soon as Brin and the soldiers leave, the Bandits get ready to set out.

"Bacon's out of the pan, lads. Let's go pay that shop keeper a visit."
"Aye, aye."
They go off to rob the Lucky Kite.

# Maycaster Castle
The party ventures to Maycastor in search of information about the location of
a mysterious portal.

## Locations

### The door guard
Shim Shaon (Guard) will approach the party as soon as they enter, asking them
what their business is and insisting they're crazy if they explain that they 
need to learn about a magic portal. He can be convinced, but will try and fight
the party if they refuse to leave or appease him. He can likewise give directions
if they get on his good side.

### Laboratory
Orlidor (Evil Mage) and Thukore (Apprentice Wizard) are working on potions for
tomorrow's battle with the undead. When the adventurers meet him, he insists
they leave, as he's very busy. If they insist, he'll hear them out. He knows the
location of a cult working on a ritual, but he'll need payment to find out where.
The payment consists of a single hair from the king.

### Knights
Ysac the Patriot(Knight), Hamlyn the Powerful(Knight), 
and Ualiar Fenwraek(Archer) sit around a round table discussing tomorrow's
battle. They'll ask for the adventurer's advice. 
If pressed for info, they'll mention that there were reports of missing people
outside the city's walls at the same time as sightings of hooded men.

### Court room
Justice Houqi Gahna(Noble) is hosting a murder trial. Chiao Muan(Commoner) claims
that Lazy Delores(Commoner) killed her parents outside the walls, but Delores 
blames a group of hooded, cloaked figures that she claims were collecting sacrifices
for a ritual. The adventurers can convince the Justice that they'll investigate the
scene of the crime to bring back evidence. They can likewise talk to Delores after
the trial concludes.

###  Armory
Melre Boneflare(Scout) tells the adventurers to leave if she sees them. 
Reoden Liltrikt(Guard), and Vamochu Dahkethab(Guard) carry a suit of platemail
into the other room. On the desk she sits at is a +1 shortsword that she's
filling out paperwork for.

Behind her there are some racks with magical items on them. She can be convinced
to sell a +1 dagger. She'll ask for 50GP, but talk down to 30GP.

### Clinic
Reoden Liltrikt(Frontline Medic) will heal the adventurers if they are injured
without asking any questions, but he says "Shhh, it's our little secret. I'm
only supposed to treat our soldiers."

### Vault
Gom Grurig (Guard) is stationed in front of a metal door. Behind it are riches
including gold bars, jewels, and pride silk.

### Public library
The librarian, Nahrezal Neshon(Commoner) will get angry if anyone talks in 
the library. If they talk her down, she will tell them about the forbidden 
library. If they keep convincing her, she'll tell them about where to find
the book on magic portals, giving them advantage on their investigation check.

### Forbidden library
The library is locked up. If the adventurers break in, they each can make a DC8
stealth check and a DC16 investigation check to find a book related to the 
portal. If they fail the stealth check, Gom Grurig (Guard) will move from the
vault to the library door and say "Hello? Who's in there?!" And start noisily
getting his keyes to unlock the door. This grants them an escape. He'll leave
and return with  Hom Virdutsk (Guard) from near the dinner party, who will then
patrol the library.

### Dinner party
As the party enters, the guests sit around an expansive table reminiscing.

Gneg the bugbear speaks up. "Remember when we were enemies? I remember planning to crush these walls."
Urgaz Brokenclaw the Gnoll joins in. "Nobody thought that weakling necromancer would rise up like this."
Grans Snow(Tabaxi Minstrel) "Yes, well, he most-certainly did. Took the theaters of Zuding straight away."
Zahnur Cemmed(Spy) laughs "It ironic. I hid here from the Zuding after killing their king. They're gone, but I still can't leave."
Uantouk (Lizardfolk) "I can smell food. Someone is cooking nearby."
Dovak Lahrit (Commoner): "Ah, our lizard friend has a sharp nose. *he drops a steaming stock pot onto the table*
    Our new specialty: boiled potato peels with old lard. Bon apetite."

### Noble meeting
- Morinari Messalina(Noble) of Darkmare
- Go-Mizunoo Tourhan(Noble) of Onora
- Oshin Pandaramn(Noble) of Hipledo
- Ainbcellach Anastasia(Noble) of Zuding
- Atsuhito Myat(Noble) of Arioburgh
- Temti-Agun NemanjiÄ‡(Noble) of Badena
The noblemen discuss politics of the countries they came from as if they
still existed.

### Temple
Tsua Tue(Priest) gives a sermon about Bahamut.
"Lord of the Wind, give me strength,
For I am not strong enough to stand up against the evil around me.
On my own, I will stumble in time, and be crushed under the tides of darkness that flood around me.
May your scales shield us.
May your fangs protect us.
Lord Bahamut, hear our prayer."

They pass around plates for offerings, and if asked about cultists, they'll explain
that there are no cultists among them, only former cultists. If pressed further,
Orth Dewcloud(Acolyte) will confess that he was with a group worshipping Azuth,
but they began to learn dark magic involving sacrifices, and so he left.

### Throne room
King Tiberius Eudokia(noble) insists that the tables can still be turned. A coalition
has formed an army to pull off a last-ditch effort to hunt down and kill Shemov
before his undead army begins the seige on Maycaster. If asked about a portal, he'll
accuse the party of being cowards. He challenges them to stay and defend Maycaster
while the attack commences tomorrow. 

His royal advisor Lo Yuang(Spy) won't admit it, but he's working for Shemov and 
is planning to lure the armies out of Maycaster in order to then launch a direct
assault under the promise that he'll get to live. If the party figures this out
and convinces the king, he will call off the assault and instead order a guard
to accompany the party in their search for the portal.


# The Cave of the cultists

## The Cabin
On their way to the location of the cult performing a ritual, they will find
a cabin with its door off the frame. Moving inside, they'll see muddy footprints
leading west into a hall to the main room, where a zombie stands over a dead man
and woman. In the other room, they find a set of chests containing three strange
outfits(robes with hoods and masks). Behind the cabin, they'll find the entrance
to the cave.

## The Cave
The cave is a natural stone formation that has carved floors and occasional
light sources. Aside from these blue orbs, camp fire, and portal, 
everything in the dungeon is pitch black and requires a torch or dark vision.

### Goblin chamber
To the West is a dead-end. The path to the East turns Northward into a T-juncture
heading continuing North or heading West. A sign pointing Northward reads
"Deadly traps ahead."(it's truthful). To The West passage is a wooden door with
three zombies gathered around a small light. They don't see the party.

The party can take either of these dangerous paths that lead into a chamber with
goblins in it. If they linger to consider their options, they hear footsteps 
and voices coming from the entrance that move West.

If the party follows stealthfully (DC10 stealth check), they will hear the goblins
knock three times before a secret passage is opened from the other side, leading
them into the goblin chamber. The three in the cavern will trade places with
the three that have just entered, leaving the party with the option to avoid
the traps and zombies and instead knock to gain entrance through the secret
passage.

Inside the goblin chamber are three tents, a small camp fire, and some goblins.

### The gargoyle
To the west there is a path leading Northward to a tomb with glowing red runes
on it. The runes read: "And so Nornush spoke the name of his
scaled god to the stone beast, and it fell
still where it was." The first time the party says "Bahamut" in this chamber, a
red glow will cover them and they will each gain 1d8 hit points and one spell slot.

North of the goblin chamber there is a statue of a gargoyle standing on a large
podium with an inscription that reads "Beware! You are in mortal danger."
If a member of the party gets close enough to read it, the gargoyle leaps to
action and gets a surprise attack on that adventurer. Otherwise reaching the
halfway point in the room will cause the gargoyle to awaken.

The gargoyle can be defeated in combat normally. If the party utters "Bahamut",
it will return to its pedestal and go stone. Neutralizing the gargoyle will
raise a port cullis leading to a chamber of cultists. The other path has a door
leading to cultists running a ritual.


### Cultists

Both chambers of cultists are connected. If attacked, the Northern group will
fight to protect the ritual going on in the ritual chamber. If the ritual
chamber is attacked, the Febam Zumol (Cult Fanatic) will call out for backup
from the other chamber, creating a very deadly encounter.

If the party enters the portal, they survive this encounter and end up in the
portal in Tandris.
